    <ul>
        <li>SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics. It is an XML-based vector image format for two-dimensional graphics with support for interactivity and animation. Unlike bitmap image formats, such as JPEG or PNG, SVG images are resolution-independent, which means that they can be scaled to any size without losing quality.</li>
        <li>SVG images are created using a combination of shapes, paths, and text. They are often used for creating logos, icons, illustrations, and other graphics for the web. SVG images can be edited and manipulated using various graphic design software, such as Adobe Illustrator, Sketch, or Inkscape.</li>
        <li>One of the advantages of SVG is that it allows for interactivity and animation, which can be achieved using scripting languages such as JavaScript. This makes SVG a popular choice for creating interactive web graphics and data visualizations.</li>
        <li>SVG images can be embedded in HTML documents using the < svg> tag or referenced as an external file using the < img> tag. They can also be used in CSS as a background image or as a mask for other HTML elements.</li>
