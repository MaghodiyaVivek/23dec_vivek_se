    <ul>
        <li>In HTML, block-level elements and inline elements are two types of elements that are used to define the structure and layout of a web page.</li>
        <li>Block-level elements are elements that take up the full width of their parent container and start on a new line. Examples of block-level elements include < div>, < p>, < h1>-< h6>, < ul>, and < li>. Block-level elements are typically used for larger chunks of content, such as paragraphs, headings, lists, and structural elements of a page.</li>
        <li>Inline elements, on the other hand, are elements that do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary. Examples of inline elements include < a>, < span>, < strong>,  < em>, and < img>. Inline elements are typically used for smaller pieces of content, such as text and images, and for applying formatting and styling to specific parts of the content.</li>
        <p>Here are some key differences between block-level elements and inline elements:</p>
        <li>Block-level elements take up the full width of their parent container, while inline elements only take up as much width as necessary.</li>
        <li>Block-level elements start on a new line, while inline elements do not.</li>
        <li>Block-level elements can contain other block-level elements and inline elements, while inline elements cannot contain block-level elements (but they can contain other inline elements).</li>
        <li>Block-level elements are used for larger chunks of content, while inline elements are used for smaller pieces of content and for applying formatting and styling.</li>
    </ul>
