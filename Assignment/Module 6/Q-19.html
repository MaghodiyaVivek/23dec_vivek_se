    <ul>
        <li>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and XHTML (Extensible Hypertext Markup Language) are two markup languages used to create web pages.</li>
        <li>The main difference between HTML and XHTML is their syntax. HTML uses a looser syntax that is forgiving of errors, whereas XHTML has a stricter syntax that requires proper structure and adherence to XML rules. XHTML is essentially an extension of XML, which is a more rigid markup language.</li>
        <p>
            Here are some key differences between HTML and XHTML:
            <ol style="color: black;">
                <li>Syntax: HTML has a looser syntax, while XHTML requires a stricter syntax with properly nested elements and closing tags.</li>
                <li>Case Sensitivity: HTML is not case sensitive, whereas XHTML is case sensitive.</li>
                <li>Document Type: HTML has different document types, such as HTML 4.01, XHTML 1.0, and HTML5. XHTML has only one document type, which is XHTML 1.0.</li>
                <li>Support for deprecated elements: HTML supports some deprecated elements, while XHTML does not.</li>
                <li>Browser Compatibility: HTML pages are generally more compatible with older web browsers, whereas XHTML pages are designed to be more forward-compatible.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <li>Overall, XHTML is considered a stricter, cleaner version of HTML, and it is often used by web developers who want to ensure their pages are well-formed and compliant with XML standards. However, HTML is still widely used and supported, and it remains the markup language of choice for many developers.</li>
