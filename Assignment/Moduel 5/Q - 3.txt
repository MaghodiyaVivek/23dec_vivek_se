3. What is Difference between DBMS and RDBMS?
Ans:-
	DBMS stands for Database Management System, while RDBMS stands for Relational 
Database Management System. The main difference between the two is that an RDBMS 
is a type of DBMS that is specifically designed to work with relational databases.

    Relational databases organize data into tables, which are composed of rows and 
columns. The columns represent the attributes of the data, while the rows 
represent the actual data values. In an RDBMS, tables can be related to one 
another through the use of foreign keys, which are used to create relationships 
between tables.
