5. What do you understand By Data Redundancy?
Ans:-
	Data redundancy can be problematic for several reasons. Firstly, it can 
waste storage space, as multiple copies of the same data must be stored. 
Secondly, it can lead to inconsistencies in the data, as changes made to 
one copy of the data may not be reflected in other copies. This can result 
in data discrepancies and inaccuracies.
